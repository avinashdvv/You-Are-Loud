## 💬 Core Messaging

### Primary Message Framework

#### Problem Statement
"Remote workers often don't realize they're speaking too loudly during video calls, disturbing household members and creating poor audio experiences for colleagues."

#### Solution Statement
"Your Are Loud provides real-time voice volume monitoring with smart notifications (after 1 minute of continuous loud speaking) and an interactive volume history graph - all while processing everything locally to protect your privacy."

#### Unique Value Proposition
"The only cross-platform voice monitor that gives you instant feedback without recording your voice - free, open source, and sponsor-supported."

### Key Messages by Audience

#### For Remote Workers
- "Never disturb your family during video calls again"
- "Build awareness of your speaking volume"
- "Your considerate-neighbor solution for shared spaces"

#### For Privacy-Conscious Users
- "100% local processing - your voice never leaves your device"
- "Open source code you can audit yourself"
- "Zero data collection - we can't see your usage because we don't track it"

#### For Technical Users
- "Modern cross-platform architecture with shared TypeScript packages"
- "Native implementations for maximum performance"
- "Clean, maintainable codebase using industry best practices"

#### For Potential Sponsors
- "Support a tool that respects users in an age of surveillance capitalism"
- "Your sponsorship enables privacy-first development"
- "Direct impact - solo developer creating genuinely useful tools"

### Taglines

**Primary Tagline:**  
"Speak at the right volume. Protect your privacy."

**Alternative Taglines:**
- "Your personal volume coach"
- "Better calls. Quieter home."
- "Real-time feedback. Zero recordings."
- "Made for remote work. Built for privacy."
- "Open source audio awareness"

### Elevator Pitches

**30-Second Pitch:**
"Your Are Loud monitors your voice during video calls and alerts you when you're speaking too loudly. It's like having a volume coach, but all processing happens on your device - nothing is recorded or sent anywhere. Available free as a Chrome extension, macOS app, Windows app, and mobile app. Open source and sponsor-supported."

**60-Second Pitch:**
"Working from home, many people don't realize they're speaking too loudly during video calls. This creates problems: disturbed family members, audio distortion for colleagues, and embarrassing mid-meeting corrections. Your Are Loud solves this with real-time volume monitoring across all platforms. You get instant visual feedback and alerts when you exceed your customizable threshold. The key difference? Absolute privacy - all processing is local, no recordings, no data collection. It's open source, so you can verify these claims yourself. And it's sustainable through sponsorships, not by selling your data. Perfect for the 60+ million remote workers worldwide."

directly enable:

- Testing across platforms
- Long-term maintenance

Would you consider sponsoring at any tier? Even $5/month helps, and 
you'd be listed as a founding sponsor.

```
Subject: Privacy-First Voice Monitor for Remote Workers

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm reaching out with a story about a new open-source project that 
addresses a surprisingly common remote work problem: not knowing when 
you're speaking too loudly during video calls.

"Your Are Loud" is a cross-platform voice monitoring tool that provides 
real-time feedback - but with a twist: it collects zero data. Everything 
is processed locally, nothing is recorded.

Why this is newsworthy:
• Addresses pain point for 60M+ remote workers
• Privacy-first approach in contrast to data-hungry alternatives  
• Solo developer, sustainably sponsor-supported
• Cross-platform (Chrome, macOS, Windows, mobile)
• Open source with 100% transparency

The developer, [Your Name], built this after repeatedly disturbing family 
members during calls. Now it's helping thousands of users.

Would you be interested in covering this? I can provide:
- Demo access
- Interview with developer
- User testimonials
- Technical deep dive
- High-res assets

Let me know if this fits your beat!

Best,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]

Project: https://github.com/[username]/your-are-loud
