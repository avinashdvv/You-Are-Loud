## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to do everything at once. Pick:
- **1 primary platform** (Reddit OR Twitter)
- **1 content type** (Blog posts OR video)
- **1 hour/day** commitment

### 2. Be Consistent
Better to do **30 min daily** than **3 hours once a week**
- Marketing compounds over time
- Relationships build slowly
- Algorithm rewards consistency

### 3. Track Progress
Use the simple spreadsheet from Quick Reference:
- Weekly numbers
- What worked
- What didn't
- Next week's focus

### 4. Engage First, Promote Second
**80/20 rule:**
- 80% helping others, engaging, adding value
- 20% promoting your project

### 5. Don't Compare
Your timeline:
- Week 4: 50 stars ✅
- Month 3: 500 stars ✅
- Month 6: 1,000 stars ✅

Not:
- "Why doesn't my launch go viral?" ❌
- "X project has 10k stars already" ❌
